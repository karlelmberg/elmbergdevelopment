Thanks for installing Kaliko CMS version 1.2.3!

Notice if you're upgrading Kaliko CMS (this doesn't apply to new projects):
============================================================================
 If you're upgrading from a previous version prior to version 1.2.1 and are 
 using either composite or collection properties it's recommended to backup 
 your existing database. In version 1.2.1 the third party JSON library was 
 replaced for security reasons. Although the replacement has been fully 
 tested we recommend as an extra precaution to backup the database.
